# Introduction

You can use `sherpa-ncnn` for **real-time** speech recognition (i.e., speech-to-text)
on

  - Linux
  - macOS
  - Windows
  - Embedded Linux (32-bit arm and 64-bit aarch64)
  - Android
  - etc ...

We support all platforms that [ncnn](https://github.com/tencent/ncnn) supports.

Everything can be compiled from source with static link. The generated
executable depends only on system libraries.

Please see the documentation <https://k2-fsa.github.io/sherpa/ncnn/index.html>
for installation and usages, e.g.,

  - How to build an Android app
  - How to download and use pre-trained models

We provide a few YouTube videos for demonstration about real-time speech recognition
